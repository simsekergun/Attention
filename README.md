# Additive Attention 

- The notebook explains how we predict the quality factor of the microrign resonators at high frequencies based on those resonators' quality factors at the lower frequencies.
- The prediction is achieved via additive attention mechanism. MSE = 0.0763, R^2 = 0.945332.
- The data is generated by Gregory Moille. Due to space limits on GitHub, the original dataset in the tensor form is divided into two: Qc_Dataset1.pt and Qc_Dataset2.pt.
- The python code is developed by Masoud Soroush and edited by Ergun Simsek. Attention.py includes functions written by Edward Raff as well.
